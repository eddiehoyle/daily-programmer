# Daily Programmer
These are my attempts are trying to solve the daily programmer challenges found on [/r/dailyprogrammer](http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer). I'm going to start at 100 and work my way up through the list while *trying* not to look at the answers that have already been submitted.

## Languages
My goal is to write each challenge in both Python and Javascript, as I'd like to continue to develop my skills with these languages.
